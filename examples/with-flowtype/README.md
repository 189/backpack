## Idea behind the example
This demonstrates how to add [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) to your Backpack project. Flow is a static type checker that helps you write code 
with fewer bugs. Check out this [introduction to using static types in JavaScript](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb) if you are new to this concept.

To learn more about Flow, take a look at [its documentation](https://flowtype.org/).
